# Benefits of using virtual dom

When you render a React component, it doesn't directly manipulate the Real DOM. Instead, it creates a Virtual DOM representation of the component's structure and state.
When the data or state of a component changes (e.g., user interaction triggers an update), React creates a new Virtual DOM representation of the component

1. Efficient updates: Virtual DOM helps minimize unnecessary updates to the actual DOM, reducing the number of reflows and repaints, resulting in better performance.

2. Faster rendering: By comparing changes in the virtual DOM first, the minimal required updates are sent to the real DOM, making rendering faster.

3. Simplified development: Developers can work with the virtual DOM, which abstracts the complexities of directly manipulating the real DOM.

4. Cross-platform compatibility: Virtual DOM allows building applications that work consistently across different browsers and platforms.

5. Improved user experience: The use of virtual DOM leads to smoother and more responsive user interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience.
