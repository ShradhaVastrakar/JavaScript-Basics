# Higher-order functions and examples?
Ans- Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. In simple terms, they treat functions as data and allow you to work with them in a more dynamic and flexible way.

Here's a straightforward explanation along with an example:

**Higher-Order Function Explanation:**
A higher-order function is like a function that operates on functions. It can accept a function as an argument or return a function as its result. This enables you to pass behavior around as if it were data.

**Example:**
Let's say you want to perform a certain operation on each element of an array. Instead of writing the operation logic inside a loop each time, you can create a higher-order function that takes an operation function as an argument and applies it to each element of the array.

```javascript
// Higher-order function
function performOperationOnArray(arr, operation) {
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        result.push(operation(arr[i]));
    }
    return result;
}

// Operation functions
function double(number) {
    return number * 2;
}

function square(number) {
    return number * number;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using the higher-order function with different operation functions
const doubledNumbers = performOperationOnArray(numbers, double);
console.log("Doubled numbers:", doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

const squaredNumbers = performOperationOnArray(numbers, square);
console.log("Squared numbers:", squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `performOperationOnArray` is a higher-order function that takes an array and an operation function as arguments. It applies the provided operation function to each element of the array and returns a new array with the results. This approach allows you to reuse the same higher-order function with different operations without rewriting the loop each time.

Higher-order functions are a powerful concept in programming, enabling more modular and reusable code by treating functions as first-class citizens.

Types of HOF  `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach` higher-order functions in JavaScript.

### `map`:

The `map` function is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. It returns a new array with the modified values.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using map to double each number
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the `map` function doubles each number in the `numbers` array and returns a new array `doubledNumbers`.

### `filter`:

The `filter` function is used to create a new array containing elements that pass a certain condition defined by a function.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using filter to get even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

Here, the `filter` function creates a new array `evenNumbers` that contains only the even numbers from the `numbers` array.

### `reduce`:

The `reduce` function is used to accumulate values from an array into a single result. It takes a function and an initial value and applies the function to each element successively.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Using reduce to calculate the sum
const sum = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, number) {
  return accumulator + number;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

In this example, the `reduce` function adds up all the numbers in the `numbers` array, starting with an initial value of `0`.

### `forEach`:

The `forEach` function is used for iterating over elements in an array and applying a function to each element. Unlike `map`, it doesn't create a new array; it simply performs an action on each element.

```javascript
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

// Using forEach to log each fruit
fruits.forEach(function (fruit) {
  console.log(fruit);
});

// Output:
// apple
// banana
// cherry
```

Here, the `forEach` function iterates over the `fruits` array and logs each fruit to the console.

These higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach`) are powerful tools in JavaScript for working with arrays in a clean and functional way, making your code more readable and maintainable.
