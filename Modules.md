# What are modules in node.js and what types and examples of all?
Ans- 
In Node.js, modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable files. They help in keeping your codebase organized, modular, and maintainable. Node.js has its own module system, commonly referred to as the CommonJS module system, which allows you to import and export code between different files.

Node.js also supports ES6-style import and export syntax using the ES Modules (ESM) system, but it requires using the .mjs file extension and adding some configuration when running Node.js with ESM enabled. The CommonJS module system shown in the example is still widely used and supported.

You're right; there is often a distinction made between three categories of modules in the context of Node.js: core (inbuilt), external, and internal modules. Let's clarify each of these:

1. **Core (Inbuilt) Modules:**
   - Core modules are built-in modules that come bundled with Node.js. These modules provide essential functionalities like interacting with the file system, working with HTTP, handling paths, etc.
   - You can use core modules by directly requiring them using their module name, without specifying a file path.

Example:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs'); // File System module
const http = require('http'); // HTTP module
```

2. **External Modules:**
   - External modules are third-party modules or packages created by developers outside of Node.js core.
   - These modules are published on the npm (Node Package Manager) registry and can be installed using the `npm` or `yarn` command.
   - To use external modules, you need to install them first, and then you can require them in your code using their names.

Example:
```javascript
const express = require('express'); // External module for building web applications
const axios = require('axios'); // External module for making HTTP requests
```

3. **Internal (Custom) Modules:**
   - Internal modules, also known as custom modules, are modules you create yourself to organize and encapsulate code into reusable files.
   - These modules are specific to your application and are not part of Node.js core or external packages.
   - Internal modules can be imported and used in your code by specifying the file path relative to your current script.

Example:
Suppose you have an `utils.js` file in the same directory as your main script:
```javascript
// utils.js
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

module.exports = {
    greet
};
```
You can then use this internal module in your main script (`app.js`):
```javascript
// app.js
const utils = require('./utils'); // Importing the internal module

const greeting = utils.greet('Alice');
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

These three categories help classify and understand different types of modules in the Node.js ecosystem: core (inbuilt) modules, external modules from npm, and your own internal (custom) modules.
