# SQL:-
SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on a structured schema and use SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data. They are typically used for complex queries and are highly consistent. 
# Examples:-
 include MySQL Oracle, and PostgreSQL On the other hand, 
 
# NoSQL:-
NoSQL databases are non-relational, meaning they can handle unstructured data and do not require a fixed schema. They are known for their ability to handle large volumes of data and for their scalability. 
# Examples:- 
include MongoDB, Cassandra, and CouchDB. 
# Key differences include:-

# 1. SQL databases are table- based, while NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. 

# 2 SQL databases have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema. 

# 3 SQL databases are usually vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable 

# 4 SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL databases are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
