# SQL:-
SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on a structured schema and use SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating the data. They are typically used for complex queries and are highly consistent. 
# Examples:-
 include MySQL Oracle, and PostgreSQL On the other hand, 
 
# NoSQL:-
NoSQL databases are non-relational, meaning they can handle unstructured data and do not require a fixed schema. They are known for their ability to handle large volumes of data and for their scalability. 
# Examples:- 
include MongoDB, Cassandra, and CouchDB. 
# Key differences include:-

# 1. SQL databases are table- based, while NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. 

# 2 SQL databases have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema. 

# 3 SQL databases are usually vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable 

# 4 SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL databases are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON. 


NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB):

Flexibility: NoSQL databases are flexible and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for scenarios where data doesn't fit neatly into tables.

Scalability: NoSQL databases are typically easier to scale horizontally, which means adding more servers to handle increased traffic or data.

Speed: NoSQL databases can be faster for certain types of queries, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

Schema-less: NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning you don't need to define a fixed structure for your data before storing it.

SQL Database (e.g., MySQL):

Structured Data: SQL databases are great for structured data with well-defined relationships between tables.

ACID Transactions: SQL databases provide strong consistency and support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which are essential for financial and critical applications.

Complex Queries: SQL databases excel in complex queries, including JOIN operations, which are useful for combining data from multiple tables.

Mature Ecosystem: SQL databases have been around for a long time and have a mature ecosystem with a wide range of tools and support.
