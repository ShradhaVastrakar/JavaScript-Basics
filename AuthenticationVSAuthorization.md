# Authentication:

Authentication is the process of confirming who you are. It's like showing your ID to prove that you are indeed the person you claim to be.

# Node.js Example: 
In a Node.js application, authentication involves checking the validity of user-provided credentials, typically through mechanisms like passport.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), or OAuth. It verifies the user's identity and usually results in the issuance of a session or access token.

# Authorization:

Authorization is what you're allowed to do after you've proven who you are. It's like getting permission to enter a certain area or use a particular service once your identity is confirmed.

# Node.js Example: 
In a Node.js application, authorization involves checking whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform a requested action or access a specific route or resource. Middleware and role-based access control (RBAC) are often used to implement authorization logic.

In a Node.js application, authentication verifies your identity, while authorization determines what you're allowed to do or access based on your identity.
