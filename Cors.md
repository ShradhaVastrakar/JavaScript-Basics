# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

CORS is like a set of rules that browsers follow to decide whether a web page running at one origin (domain) can request and use resources from a different origin (domain).
It's a security feature to prevent potentially harmful web pages from making requests to different websites on your behalf.

# CORS Headers:

CORS headers are like special instructions that a web server sends to a web browser.
These headers tell the browser which origins are allowed to access the resources on the server.
They also define what HTTP methods (like GET, POST, etc.) and headers can be used in cross-origin requests.

# CORS Methods:

CORS methods are like the actions you can take when making requests across different websites.
Common CORS methods include GET (to retrieve data), POST (to send data), and OPTIONS (to check if a request is allowed).
These methods help define the type of interaction that's allowed between different web pages.

# CORS Configuration:

CORS configuration is like setting up the rules for how different websites can interact with your website.
It involves configuring your web server to include the right CORS headers in its responses.
You specify which origins, methods, and headers are permitted to access your resources.
In simple terms, CORS is a security feature that allows or restricts web pages from different websites to communicate with each other. CORS headers, methods, and configuration are tools that help define and enforce these rules, ensuring that your web resources are accessed safely and only by trusted sources.
